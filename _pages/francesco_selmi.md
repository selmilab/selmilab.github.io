Francesco Selmi (Vignola, 7 April 1817 – 13 August 1881) was an Italian chemist, patriot, inventor and entrepreneur, one of the founders of colloid chemistry. Among all his interests, he was also a researcher of Dante Alighieri's work. We believe that nowadays he would have been a great computational scientist.
