    title: "Scientist"
    excerpt: "Francesco Selmi (Vignola, 7 April 1817 – 13 August 1881) was an Italian chemist, patriot, inventor and entrepreneur, one of the founders of colloid chemistry. Among all his interests, he was also a researcher of Dante Alighieri’s work. We believe that nowadays he would have been a great computational scientist."

    title: "Inventor and entrepreneur"
    excerpt: "In 1855, Francesco Selmi invented the triple-contact pile. The advantages of the new battery were its constant voltage, its low cost compared to existing batteries, its simplicity of construction and maintenance, and the absence of harmful fumes. The battery was used continuously in the Turin telegraph station from December 1856 until May 1857, where up to 100 cells were installed."
