# Projects

### Deep Learning for Remote Sensing - Land Use / Land Cover
The aim of the project is to use a deep learning model to classify satellite images at the pixel level. In other words it implements a neural network for semantic segmentation. One application is land use and land cover. Other related tasks are change detection and satellite image time series. Deep learning models are used to address basic computer vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection applied to satellite and aerial imagery. Continuous monitoring the land cover is relevant for land management, agriculture, wildfires, land surface roughness and albedo. Once pixels of a satellite or aerial image can be mapped to a class from a LULC taxonomy it can be used to extract statistical information about the area.

### Rooftop Type Identification
Energy efficiency and renewables are two  core elements of the European strategy to mitigate climate change, and even more so after the energy market disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In order to make  a more informed transition to renewables and to more energy efficient buildings, the EU is collecting data to assess the actual energy efficiency of buildings in Europe and the solar energy potential of the buildings’ rooftop, in particular in urban areas.
The goal of the Rooftop Type Identification (RTI) project is to classify the rooftop type of buildings from VHR satellite imagery, using computer vision and machine learning algorithms, in order to assess the feasibility of installing solar power panels on rooftops, in particular in urban areas, and also potentially infer other building’s characteristics such as its age and change in time. The shape of the rooftop, whether it is flat, gabled, pyramidal, or other type, with additional building’s attributes, will allow a more accurate estimation of the building's solar potential and energy efficiency at the EU scale.
